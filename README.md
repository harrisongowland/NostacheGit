# Nostache Generator

Do you want to make a #nostache video, obscuring the moustaches in Jacksfilms' mustache sketch, but can't be bothered to learn keyframe animation or download video editing software? Well, fear not, because the latest GowlandTech innovation has the solution for you. Using high performance image processing library Sharp and FFmpeg, this program will automate the entire process of covering up Jacksfilms and company's moustaches without even needing to open Windows Movie Maker. 

# Nota bene

This program is largely untested. It seems to work on Windows and no longer requires FFmpeg to be installed for it to run, but further testing by external users is required to verify it - as such, this program is not strictly speaking production ready. [Please consult the eula](NostacheGenerator/eula.txt) before downloading.
